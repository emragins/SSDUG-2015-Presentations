Wix# w/ Jim Daniels
=========================================================================

######Presented on May 14th 2015 @ the Olympia Center in Olympia, WA

Bio:  Jim Daniels is an Application Developer with the State of Washington, working primarily with the Microsoft .NET stack. For decades, he has had an affinity for both Anders-Hejlsberg-designed programming languages and all things related to software deployment. So it seemed only natural he would take a liking to Wix#, an open source tool for building Windows Installer MSIs using the C# language.  

Jim will demo the use of Wix# to build a couple simple Windows installers in C#. The session is intended as a code-along exercise, so bring your laptop with Visual Studio 2013, and we will build MSI's you can install and then uninstall. If possible, install Wix# from NuGet prior to the session.   

To demo Wix# use, we will build a registry installer that adds a "Take Ownership" shortcut to your Explorer right-click menu, and then build an installer for an open source Pomodoro timer application. Examples of Wix# installers for other types of installers, such as for Windows Services, COM-Callable wrappers, and ASP.NET web applications will also be shown.

Wix# a C# front end for the Windows Installer XML (WiX) Toolkit, that takes C# code as input and emits XML that WiX compiles into an MSI. For additional information on the WiX toolkit, see [Wix Toolset](http://wixtoolset.org/) and also see the Pluralsight course on WiX.
