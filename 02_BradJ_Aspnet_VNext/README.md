=========================================================================

######Presented on Febuary 12th 2014 @ the Olympia Center in Olympia, WA

Come see whats new with the next version ASP.NET. Where does nodejs fit into the picture? Where did they move my cheese? (What has changed with routing, HttpContext, WebApi?). I will be going over using the next version of ASP.NET on Mac and using sublime text. I will also be using some VS2015 on windows.

Brad works for CodeSmart Inc. But in his spare time he helps run the South Sound .NET Development group. When he is not hacking away at something on the computer, he can be found attempting to play an instrument of some kind.
